The dataset ”[amazon alexa.tsv]” obtained from Kaggle
offers a comprehensive overview of user ratings and feedback for various Amazon Alexa products. It provides insights
into how these products are perceived by customers through
verified reviews and feedback.The dataset includes attributes
such as product variation, review text, rating, and feedback.
The dataset primarily consists of product reviews, where users
provide suggestions and feedback based on the quality of the
product. Reviews cover a range of products, such as charcoal
fabric, walnut fabric, heater gray fabric, etc., with corresponding ratings reflecting user satisfaction levels. Overall,
this dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing user
sentiments, offering ratings, and gathering comments based
on user feedback.Our dataset is diverse and encompasses a
wide range of reviews, allowing for comprehensive sentiment
analysis.

Overall, text mining and NLP techniques are used primarily
during the data preprocessing stage to clean and transform
the raw text data into a format suitable for machine learning
models.In summary, the XGBoost classifier model is applied in
the training and evaluation phase to classify text data based on
the features extracted using text mining and natural language
processing techniques.


In conclusion, this project underscores the significance of
leveraging machine learning and NLP techniques to extract
valuable insights from text data. By enabling businesses to
make informed decisions and foster meaningful interactions
with their customers, these techniques play a crucial role in
driving success and innovation
